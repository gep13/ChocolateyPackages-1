The Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter helps you automatically repair issues when you're blocked from installing or removing programs. It also fixes corrupted registry keys.

The troubleshooter provides steps for you to follow. If a program isn't listed in the uninstall options, you'll be asked for that program's product code. To access the code, you'll need a tool for reading MSI files—which is typically available to IT professionals. You'll find the product code in the property table of the MSI file.

### What it fixes
* Corrupted registry keys on 64-bit operating systems
* Corrupted registry keys that control the update data
* Problems that prevent new programs from being installed
* Problems that prevent existing programs from being completely uninstalled or updated
* Problems that block you from uninstalling a program through Add or Remove Programs (or Programs and Features) in Control Panel

### Runs on
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 10
